# Comparative-Bacterial-Genome-Assembly-SPAdes-Flye-Unicycler
A bioinformatics project comparing the performance of three genome assemblers (SPAdes, Flye, and Unicycler) on Illumina short-read data for a bacterial isolate. The project evaluates assembly quality based on contiguity, completeness, and the accurate detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes.
